			<span>At most restaurants, menu descriptions are a lifeless list of ingredients. A good description adheres to a set of best practices, and you don't have to be a writer to benefit from them. When written well, descriptions convey the soul of your restaurant and lead to higher profits.Dry food can be desiccated and withered like an old prune. Sometimes dry food keeps better, as beans and pulses; then being dry is a desirable trait. The dry weight –the solid part- in canned food gives you an idea of the real nutritional value. But most times dry food is juiceless and tasteless, lacking moisture -it will need a sauce. Food with a sharp, biting taste, or with a high proportion of strong alcohol is also dry. Food eaten without any spread, sauce or garnish would be eaten dry. Overcooked meat gets dry, having lost all juices.
